# RAG your [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/what-is-notion)

### THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND NOT USE-ABLE YET, BUT YOU CAN REVIEW THE CODE FOR REFERENCE.

With the recent advancements in AI specific to LLMs, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular way to augment the context of LLMs at the time of response, to get specific answers to queries on data which the LLM was never trained on. This data could be your company specific data, or even your personal notes, which you are looking to get some answers from.

In this project I create a RAG agent which can work on your personal [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/what-is-notion) data. I have been using Notion for quite a while to take daily notes and plan my trips, budgets, etc. So having the capability to get quick responses from this data is super important and helpful for me.

If you are also a Notion user, you can [follow these steps to extract your data from your Notion account](https://www.notion.so/help/export-your-content) and then use this project to have a chat interface on this data.
